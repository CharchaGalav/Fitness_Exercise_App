# Fitness_Exercise_App
Made a fitness exercise app with React which lets you search for different exercises through exercise name, bodypart name or exercise equipment name. Exercises are described with the help of great gifâ€™s and youtube video links are also present to help you explore more and learn by watching actual person. 

I have also deployed this app on Netlify. Here is the link:

By clicking on any of the exercise cards you will reach this page where a brief detail of your clicked exercise, youtube videos links, similar target muscles and similar equipment exercises are present.
